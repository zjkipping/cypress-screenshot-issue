# CypressScreenshotIssue

## Getting Started

Run `npm install` or `yarn`

## Creating screenshots

Run `npm run e2e` or `yarn e2e` and look in the `dist/cypress/apps/example-app-e2e/screenshots/app.cy.ts` folder for the 6 screenshots.

There should be 2 for each resolution. One with the `capture` set to `runner` and another set to `fullPage`.
